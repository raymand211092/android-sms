# Android-SMS
Wrapper app for [mautrix-imessage](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage) to bridge SMS from your Android phone to Matrix.

# Versions
Latest stable release ->
https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms/-/tags/0.1.89

The 0.2.* versions are alpha and don't support the long running foreground service yet, causing your bridge to malfunction if used as a standalone app.
They'll be refactored to support it again in a future release.
